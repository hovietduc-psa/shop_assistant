# Shop Assistant AI - Detailed Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building a real-time AI-powered sales and consulting agent that enhances customer engagement and support. This system acts as a virtual assistant providing instant help to customers 24/7, handling everything from product advice to order issues, built in Python with scalable, secure architecture integrating seamlessly with e-commerce and CRM platforms. **The system provides a comprehensive REST API for frontend integration, with no direct UI or mobile development required.**

## Development Methodology
This project follows an agile development approach with incremental stages. Each stage builds upon the previous one, allowing for continuous testing, feedback, and iteration. The plan is divided into **20 distinct development stages** across 4 major development cycles.

## LLM-First Architecture Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as the primary intelligence engine, replacing traditional rule-based systems and machine learning approaches wherever possible.

### LLM-First Approach Benefits:
- **Flexibility:** Handle complex, nuanced user queries without rigid rule systems
- **Adaptability:** Easily extend capabilities through prompt engineering vs. model retraining
- **Natural Conversation:** More human-like interactions without predefined dialogue trees
- **Rapid Development:** Faster iteration through prompt refinement vs. model training
- **Scalability:** Single LLM handles multiple tasks vs. separate ML models

### LLM vs Traditional Approach Comparison:

| Task | Traditional Approach | LLM-First Approach |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Intent Classification** | Train custom ML model with labeled data | Use few-shot prompting with GPT-4 |
| **Entity Extraction** | spaCy NER patterns or CRF models | Function calling with structured output |
| **Dialogue Management** | State machines or Rasa policies | Dynamic conversation flow via LLM reasoning |
| **Response Generation** | Template-based responses | Dynamic, context-aware generation |
| **Product Recommendations** | Collaborative filtering algorithms | LLM analysis of user needs and preferences |
| **Escalation Decisions** | Rule-based triggers | LLM analysis of conversation context and sentiment |
| **Quality Assessment** | Manual review or simple metrics | LLM-powered nuanced evaluation |

### LLM Implementation Strategy:

**Primary LLM Tasks:**
1. **Natural Language Understanding** - Intent classification, entity extraction, sentiment analysis
2. **Dialogue Management** - Context tracking, conversation flow decisions, memory management
3. **Response Generation** - Dynamic, personalized responses with appropriate tone and style
4. **Decision Making** - Escalation triggers, routing decisions, quality assessments
5. **Knowledge Integration** - RAG for product information, comparison, and recommendations
6. **Analytics & Insights** - Conversation analysis, pattern recognition, improvement suggestions

**Fallback Strategy:**
- Primary: OpenRouter OpenAI GPT-4 for most tasks
- Secondary: OpenRouter Anthropic Claude for diversity and backup
- Tertiary: Simplified rule-based system for critical failures
- Embedding Fallback: Cohere primary embeddings with backup embedding service

**LLM Optimization Techniques:**
- Prompt engineering for consistent, reliable outputs
- Few-shot learning for task-specific behavior
- Chain-of-thought reasoning for complex decisions
- Structured outputs via function calling
- Context window management for long conversations
- Caching of frequent LLM calls for cost optimization

## API-First Architecture

**Core Principle:** Design a comprehensive REST API that enables frontend developers to build any interface (web, mobile, or third-party integrations) without backend modifications.
